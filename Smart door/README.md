- In this project I developed a security system that controls a door.
- The user first have the set the password then the password is saved in an EEPROM.
- The user interface consists of and LCD and a keypad.
- The LCD displays two options 
    1. Open the door.
    2. Change password.
- In each option the user have to enter the password if the password hase been entered wrong three times an alarm would go off.
- If the password is correct the operation is done correctly.
